# UI5 Extensibility Playground

This is some playground repository for the corresponding [Wiki](https://github.com/wridgeu/wridgeu.github.io/wiki), in order to play around with some UI5 extensibility features like:

* Extending standard controls
* Creating custom controls
* Creating XMLComposite controls

# Getting Started

You can just clone this repository, run npm install and use the [UI5 tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling) to locally serve the application in order to debug/learn from it. 

* __Note:__ it already uses the livereload-middleware for the [UI5 tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling), so changes while serving trigger an immediate update in the browser.

1. Clone the repository
    ```sh
    $> git clone <repository-url>
    ```
1. Navigate into the cloned repository 
    ```sh
    $> cd <repository>
    ```
1. Install all dependencies
    ```sh
    $> npm install
    ```
1. Start the application
    ```sh
    $> npm start
    ```

# Q/A
