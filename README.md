# UI5 Extensibility Playground

This is some playground repository for the corresponding [Wiki](https://github.com/wridgeu/wridgeu.github.io/wiki), in order to play around with some UI5 extensibility features like:

* Extending standard controls
* Creating custom controls
* Creating XMLComposite controls

> [!NOTE]
> This repository has become quite old and mostly serves as small playground, nothing more. For a great start into creating custom controls, have a look at the official [UI5 Docs](https://ui5.sap.com/#/topic/8dcab0011d274051808f959800cabf9f)!

## Getting Started

You can just clone this repository, run npm install and use the [UI5 tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling) to locally serve the application in order to debug/learn from it. 

* __Note:__ it already uses the livereload-middleware for the [UI5 tooling](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-tooling), so changes while serving trigger an immediate update in the browser.

1. Clone the repository

    ```sh
    $> git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate into the cloned repository 

    ```sh
    $> cd <repository>
    ```

3. Install all dependencies

    ```sh
    $> npm install
    ```

4. Start the application

    ```sh
    $> npm start
    ```

## Q/A

* I'm open for any feedback, pull requests or written change proposals.
* Yes, I deleted everything related to testing on purpose.
* It's just meant to help with my personal learning and as playground for some of the [Wiki](https://github.com/wridgeu/wridgeu.github.io/wiki) content.
